- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zboubix, 16 yrs old enthusiast :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming (of course :D), chess, guitar and math
- ðŸŒ± I go to the gym and I like to do some stuff on a pull up bar :)

Math classes in 10th grade are just too easy hence boring, so I'm developing games and other apps on my calculator :D
