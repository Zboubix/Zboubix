- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zboubix, 15 years old nerd :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming (of course :D) and especially functional programming. I also play chess : lichess.org/@/Codeur_gameur 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming on freeCodeCamp, and I'm willing to get into AI soon. 

Math classes in 10th grade are just too easy hence boring, so I'm developing games and other apps on my calculator :D

  "Programming isn't about what you know, it's actually about what you can figure out."
